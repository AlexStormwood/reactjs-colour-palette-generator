# ReactJS Colour Palette Generator

Building up a free alternative to cool colour palette generator websites.

Generating convenient lists of colour values shouldn't cost you anything. That's silly.

## Deployed Website

## Usage

This site is in active development, this documentation may be out of date.

Pick a colour, press "Generate palette".

The screen will display 10 columns of colours - the colours are a series of tones based on the colour you provided.

If you're trying to create commonly-used 100-900 ranges of a colour, it may be best to start with the 50 or 100 version of the colour. As in, the super-duper-light-and-pale version of the colour that you want.

This functionality will change over time as we definitely wanna improve this!
